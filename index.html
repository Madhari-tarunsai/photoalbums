        <span style="background-color: aqua"><q>Photographs</q></span> is the
        art, application, and practice of
        <mark>
          images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image
          sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
          photographic film.</mark

        It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
        photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for

        A person who makes photographs is called a photographer. Typically, a
        lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a
        real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed
        exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a
        digital image file for subsequent display or processing.

            image,</span
          >
          which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either
          negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic
          material and the method of processing.</b
        ><span></span> A negative image on film is traditionally used to
        photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a
        print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.
